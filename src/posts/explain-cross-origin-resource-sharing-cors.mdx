You are learning how to build a full-stack, micro-service application. You have
a beautiful front-end app. You build a sophisticated REST API. Now, you want to
connect the two together to create a seamless experience for your users.
However, you run into a problem. Your front-end app is blocked from accessing
the results from your REST API requests. This is the notorious CORS error.

# What is CORS?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by
default in most modern web browser. The idea is to prevent requests made to
different origins from happening.

A common scenario in web developmentn is when a web page makes a request to a
different domain, whether it is a subdomain, a different port, different scheme,
or a completely different third-party domain. This is considered a cross-origin
request.

    autonumber
    participant mypage.com
    participant api.mypage.com
    participant somethirdpartypage.com/api


    critical Request internal data
        mypage.com->>+api.mypage.com: GET /v1/users/123345
        api.mypage.com-->>-mypage.com: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        mypage.com->>mypage.com: Prepare data

        Note over mypage.com,api.mypage.com: Data displayed
    end

    critical Request external data
        mypage.com->>+somethirdpartypage.com/api: GET /v1/accounts/something
        somethirdpartypage.com/api-->>-mypage.com: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        mypage.com-xmypage.com: CORS Error

        Note over mypage.com,somethirdpartypage.com/api: Data displayed
    end
```
