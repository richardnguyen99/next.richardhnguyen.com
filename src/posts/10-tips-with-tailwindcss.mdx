Over the past couple of years, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has
become one of the most popular CSS frameworks for building modern websites. The
beauty of TailwindCSS is that it allows you to build complex designs without
worrying about creating separate components. This post will show you 10 tips
that will help you get the most out of TailwindCSS.

{/* EXCERPT */}

# Introduction

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build complex
designs from a composition of small, single-purpose utility classes directly in
your markup. TailwindCSS works perfectly with browser-heavy frameworks like
React, Vue and server-side frameworks like Next.js thanks to its efficiency and
zero runtime.

TailwindCSS proves that it resolves many issues of working with CSS and UI
systems. You can have a better grasp of your components by looking at them in
your components' markup. You save time and energy from coming up with names
for a simple component.

<div className="mb-8">
  <CSSComparisonChart />
</div>

# Arbitary values

TailwindCSS ships with a predefined set of utility classes that you can use
immediately. For example, Tailwind provides a set of predefined [color system](
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) and [spacing system](
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing#default-spacing-scale). You
can use them directly in your markup.

```html
<div className="bg-blue-500 p-4">
  <p className="text-white">Hello, world!</p>
</div>
```

However, you can also use arbitrary values in your utility classes with the
syntax `property-[value]`. For example:

```html
<div
  class="bg-[#bada55] text-[22px] before:content-['Festivus'] grid grid-cols-[fit-content(theme(spacing.32))]"
>
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

This feature works very well with properties that support arbitrary values like
`background-color`, `font-size`, `color`, etc. However, properties like
`display` don't support arbitrary values.

# Arbitary properties

TailwindCSS also allows you to use arbitrary properties in your utility classes
to use some CSS properties that are not covered by TailwindCSS. For example:

```html
<div class="[mask-type:luminance] hover:[mask-type:alpha] [display:block]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

This syntax is like how you would write CSS in a stylesheet and you wrap around
the property with square brackets. You can also use this feature to write
custom CSS variables:

```html
<div class="[--my-custom-property:10px]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

<Callout title="Whitespace caution" type="warning" collapsible>

A common mistake is to use some whitespaces in the syntax like how you would do
in CSS. However, TailwindCSS doesn't support whitespaces in the syntax. You can
either remove the whitespaces or use an underscore `_` instead.

```html
<!-- This will not work -->
<div class="[mask-type: luminance]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>

<!-- This will work -->
<div class="[mask-type:_luminance]">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

</Callout>

# Dynamic styles

A common case in building web components is to apply styles based on some sort
of states. For example, we have a button component that changes its background
color based on the state of the button.

```tsx
{/* This won't work */}
<button className={`bg-${
  state === "danger" ? "red" : (
  state === "warning" ? "yellow" : "blue"
)}-500`}>
</button>
```

This won't work because TailwindCSS doesn't support dynamic styles or any
client-side logics. Every class names must be extractable at build time.

```tsx
{/* This will work */}
<button className={`${
  state === "danger" ? "bg-red-500" : (
  state === "warning" ? "bg-yellow-500" : "bg-blue-500"
)}`}>
</button>
```

# Client-side styles

But what if there is a situation where you really need to apply styles from the
client-side? For example, you are building a floating modal that needs the
current width of the device screen so that you can set the appropriate padding

```tsx {11,17}
import { useWindowSize } from "@uidotdev/usehooks";

function App() {
  const { width } = useWindowSize();

  return (
    <main
      className="flex flex-col items-center gap-8 py-16 max-w-[1280px] mx-auto"
      style={
        {
          "--container-size": `${width}px`,
        } as CSSProperties
      }
    >
      {/* ... */}

      <p className="absolute bottom-4 bg-amber-500 p-4 rounded-lg w-[calc(var(--container-size)-48px)] left-[24px] border border-yellow-700 text-amber-50">

      </p>
    </main>
  );
}
```
