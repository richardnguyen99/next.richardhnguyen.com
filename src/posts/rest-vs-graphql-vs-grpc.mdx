REST has been the most dominiant design patterns for API applications. Then,
after a booming of mobile applications, GraphQL was introduced to solve the
over/under fetching problems of REST. And now, gRPC is gaining popularity as
a highly-efficient protocol for microservices.

# Introduction

REST (Representational State Transfer) has been the industrial-standard
architectural style for building web APIs. In 2023, 86% of APIs are RESTful
[^1]. Later, GraphQL was introduced as a solution to a more efficient data
fetching solution for mobile applications.
