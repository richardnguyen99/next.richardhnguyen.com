[ShikiJS](https://shiki.style/) is the most popular code syntax highlighter. But how do you integrate it into your Next.JS project?

{/* EXCERPT */}

# Introduction

[ShikiJS](https://shiki.style/) is a powerful code syntax highlighter based on
TextMate Grammar, which is the same engine that powers VSCode. ShikiJS has been
used in many popular projects such as [NextJS landing page](https://nextjs.org/),
and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). In  this post,

# Why ShikiJS?

There are some existing syntax highlighters that are well supported and powerful
such as [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/),
[HighlightJS](https://highlightjs.org/). However, these are designed to run in
the browser. ShikiJS takes a different approach called **highlighting ahead of
time**. Instead of shipping raw code content to the browswer then highlighting
it, ShikiJS will ship the highlighted code content as HTML to the browswer. This
is a more efficient approach for static site generators and server-rendering
like NextJS.
