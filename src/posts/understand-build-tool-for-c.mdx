For a single-source-file C project, `gcc` is sufficient to compile the code.
But what if your projects have multiple steps and a huge number of source files?
How do you check if a dependency is missing? How do you automate the build
process? That's where build tools such as `make` and `cmake` come into play.

# Introduction

When you first learned C or C++ programming language, you might have needed a
simple `gcc` command to compile your code. What if you have a bigger project
that requires multiple source files and libraries? Sure, a `gcc` command would
do just fine compiling all the source files? But what if your project has
50+ source files, or simply you want to automate the build process? That's
where all the build tools come into play. In this post, we will discuss the
most common build tools for C and C++ projects: `gcc`, `make`, `cmake`, and
`autoconfig`.
