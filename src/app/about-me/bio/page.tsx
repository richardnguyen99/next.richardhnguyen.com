            <p>
              I&apos;m a software engineer from the Washington, US. Writing
              software and blogs that help people solve problems is my passion.
              My specialties are building fullstack web applications from modern
              frameworks such as NextJS and React, old school server-side
              rendered like Flask and Django to complete HTTP servers in C.

        <h4>My story</h4>

        <p>I was born in Vietnam in 1999 and lived there unitl 2019.</p>

        <p>
          I was attending to{" "}

            University of Economics and Laws
          </a>{" "}
          for my second year with a Finance major. Although I love economy and
          finance, I hate using the tools that are available for me to work with
          such as Excel and Stata. Then, I found out about Python and its
          ecosystem for data analysis and data manipulation. Tools like Pandas,
          Numpy, and Matplotlib got me hooked into programming. Since then, I
          fell for it and discovered my passion for software engineering.
